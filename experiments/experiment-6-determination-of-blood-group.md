# Experiment 6: Determination of Blood Group

**Aim:**  
To determine the blood group of my own blood sample.

**Requirements:**  
Lancet, denatured spirit or ethanol solution, monoclonal antibodies (Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D kit), glass slide, toothpicks, cotton swab

## Introduction

A person's blood group is determined by the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of their red blood cells. Blood group detection is termed ‘typing of blood.’ Although there are more than 10 blood grouping systems, the universally accepted ABO system classifies blood into four main groups.

**Importance:**  
Blood transfusion is essential in conditions such as acute or chronic hemorrhage, shock, severe anemia, or carbon monoxide poisoning.

**Principle:**  
Blood group determination is based on agglutination—the clumping of red blood cells—when specific antigens on the red blood cells meet their corresponding antibodies in the serum.

- **Antigens:** Proteins on the surface of red blood cells. The key antigens for blood typing are A and B.
- **Antibodies:** Proteins in the plasma that react with specific antigens.

### ABO Blood Group System

- **Type A:** A antigens on red blood cells; anti-B antibodies in plasma.
- **Type B:** B antigens; anti-A antibodies.
- **Type AB:** Both A and B antigens; no anti-A or anti-B antibodies.
- **Type O:** No A or B antigens; both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.

## Procedure (Slide Technique)

1. Sterilize the fingertip with spirit and make a bold prick for free blood flow.
2. Place three drops of blood on a microscope slide.
3. Mix one drop with anti-A serum, the second with anti-B serum, and the third with anti-D serum.
4. Wait several minutes for agglutination to occur.
5. Observe under a microscope for clumping, indicating a reaction.
