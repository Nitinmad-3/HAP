## Introduction

Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per minute. During ventricular systole, the apex of the heart strikes the thoracic wall, creating the heartbeat. Heart rate and pulse rate differ: heart rate measures heartbeats, while pulse rate measures pressure waves in arteries. Heart rate is measured via ECG, stethoscope, or electronic monitors; pulse rate is measured by palpating arteries (wrist, neck, groin).

## Procedure

**For Pulse Rate:**

- **Radial Pulse Method:**  
  Place two fingers between the bone and tendon over the radial artery at the wrist (thumb side).
- **Carotid Pulse Method:**  
  Place index and third fingers on the neck beside the windpipe.
- **Pedal Pulse Method:**  
  Palpate the artery on the top of the foot.
- **Brachial Pulse Method:**  
  Used in young children; place fingers on the inside of the arm at the elbow.

**For Heart Rate:**

- Allow the subject to relax (sit or lie supine).
- Locate pulse and place fingers on the wrist below the base of the thumb.
- Adjust stethoscope earpieces, place diaphragm on left upper chest (4thâ€“6th rib).
- Listen for one minute, count the heartbeats.
