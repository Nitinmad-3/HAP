# Experiment 11: Enumeration of Total Red Blood Corpuscles (RBC) Count

**Aim:**  
To enumerate total red blood corpuscles (RBC) count.

**Requirements:**  
Denatured spirit or alcohol, lancet, cotton swab, RBC fluid, RBC pipette, Neubauer’s chamber

## Introduction

Red blood cells (RBCs) are round, biconcave discs that transport gases throughout the body. Their shape allows flexibility for easy passage through capillaries. RBCs are 7.2–7.4 microns in diameter and are non-nucleated, containing hemoglobin for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. The average RBC lifespan is 100–120 days.

Counting RBCs directly under the microscope is impractical due to their high number. Instead, a hemocytometer (Neubauer’s chamber) is used after diluting the blood specimen (typically 1:200) with RBC diluting fluid (Hayem’s Fluid), which preserves and fixes RBCs.

## Procedure

1. Fill the RBC pipette up to the 0.5 mark with blood specimen, wipe the exterior.
2. Fill the pipette with RBC diluting fluid up to the 101 mark, avoiding air bubbles.
3. Mix blood and diluting fluid by rotating the pipette horizontally.
4. Clean Neubauer’s chamber and cover glass, place coverslip on chamber.
5. Discard 1–2 drops from pipette, then charge the chamber by capillary action (avoid overcharging/air bubbles).
6. Wait 3–5 minutes for cells to settle.
7. Focus chamber under microscope and count RBCs.

### Calculation

- Count RBCs in 5 specific squares of the central area (let this be ‘N’).
- Area of 5 small squares = 1/5 sq.mm; depth = 0.1 mm.
- Total RBC count = N × Dilution / (Area × Depth) = N × 200 / (1/5 × 0.1) = N × 10,000 / mm³

**Report:**  
The total red blood cell count was found to be _____ millions/mm³ of blood.
