## Introduction

Muscle tissue is one of the four fundamental tissue types of the human body and is associated with nerves, blood vessels, and various connective tissues. Muscles are complex structures and are a marvel of both biology and physics.

### General Characteristics

1. **Excitability**  
   - The ability to receive and respond to stimuli.
   - In skeletal muscle, the stimulus is a neurotransmitter released by a neuron.
   - In smooth muscle, the stimulus can be a neurotransmitter, hormone, or stretch.
   - In cardiac muscle, the stimulus could be a neurotransmitter, hormone, or stretch.
   - The response is the generation of an electrical impulse that travels along the plasma membrane of the muscle cell.

2. **Contractility**  
   - The ability to contract forcibly when adequately stimulated.
   - This is the defining property of muscle tissue.

3. **Extensibility**  
   - The ability to be stretched or extended.

4. **Elasticity**  
   - The ability to recoil and resume original length after being stretched.

### Functions

- Movement
- Locomotion
- Maintenance of posture
- Heat production
- Facial expressions
- Pumping blood
- Peristalsis (movement of substances through internal organs)

## Types of Muscle Tissue

### 1. Skeletal Muscle

- **Description:** Long, striated cells with multiple nuclei.
- **Function:** Contraction for voluntary movements.
- **Location:** Attached to bones (skeletal muscles).

### 2. Smooth Muscle

- **Description:** Long, spindle-shaped cells with a single nucleus.
- **Function:** Propulsion of substances along internal passageways.
- **Location:** Walls of hollow organs (e.g., stomach, intestines, blood vessels).

### 3. Cardiac Muscle

- **Description:** Branching, striated cells fused at plasma membrane.
- **Function:** Pumping of blood in the circulatory system.
- **Location:** Wall of the heart.

## Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue is the most complex tissue in the human body, formed by a network of more than 100 million nerve cells, supported by many more glial cells. Each neuron typically makes thousands of connections with other neurons, forming a highly complex nervous system.

### Functions

- Regulates and controls body functions
- Generates and transmits nerve impulses
- Supports, insulates, and protects impulse-generating neurons

### Composition

Nervous tissue is composed of two main elements:
1. **Neurons:**  
   - **Description:** Branching cells; cell processes may be quite long and extend from the nucleus-containing cell body.
   - **Function:** Transmit electrical signals from sensory receptors and to effectors (muscles and glands) that control their activity.
   - **Location:** Brain, spinal cord, and nerves.

2. **Neuroglia:** Support cells that assist neurons.
