# Experiment 12: Enumeration of Total White Blood Corpuscles (WBC) Count

**Aim:**  
To enumerate total white blood corpuscles (WBC) count.

**Requirements:**  
Denatured spirit or alcohol, lancet, cotton swab, WBC fluid (Turk’s fluid), WBC pipette, Neubauer’s chamber

## Introduction

White blood cells (WBCs) or leucocytes are nucleated, actively amoeboid cells that do not contain hemoglobin and originate from extravascular tissue. They are composed of nucleoproteins and enzymes, and have a shorter lifespan than RBCs. WBCs exist as granulocytes (eosinophil, basophil, neutrophil) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes). Their main function is phagocytosis—defending the body against foreign particles and bacteria, antibody formation, and repair during inflammation.

To count WBCs: blood is diluted 1:20 in a WBC pipette with diluting fluid (water: glacial acetic acid: gentian violet = 97:2:1). Glacial acetic acid lyses RBCs, while gentian violet stains WBC nuclei for visibility under the microscope.

Normal WBC count: 5000–10,000 /mm³ or 7–11 thousand cells/μl in healthy individuals. WBC count is useful in diagnosis—leucocytosis (high count) occurs in infections, leucopenia (low count) in conditions like influenza or typhoid.

## Procedure

1. Sterilize fingertip with alcohol, let dry.
2. Prick fingertip for free blood flow, draw blood in WBC pipette up to 0.5 mark.
3. Fill pipette with WBC diluting fluid up to 11 mark, mix by swirling.
4. Prepare hemocytometer with coverslip, charge chamber with diluted blood by capillary action (no air bubbles/overfilling).
5. Leave chamber for 3 minutes for cell settling.
6. Observe under microscope (low power).

### Calculation

- Count WBCs in 4 small squares (let total be N).
- Area of 1 square = 1 mm²; depth = 0.1 mm.
- Volume in 4 squares = 0.4 mm³.
- Total WBC = N × 50 / mm³

**Report:**  
The total white blood cell count was found to be _____ /mm³ of blood.
