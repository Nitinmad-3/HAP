## Introduction

Haemoglobin (Hb) is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body. Estimation of haemoglobin is a crucial test for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like anaemia. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues and returns carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs.

### Principle

Sahli’s Hellige method (acid haematin method) involves converting haemoglobin to acid haematin using a strong acid. The resulting brown colour is compared with a standard glass comparator. The haemoglobin value is read directly from the scale.

**Apparatus:**  
Sahli-Hellige haemoglobinometer—cabinet with graduated glass tube and colour comparator. The glass tube is graduated in millilitres and grams of haemoglobin per 100 ml blood. The haemoglobin pipette is graduated in microlitres.

### Hb Estimation Methods

1. **Colorimetric Methods**
   - Cyanmethemoglobin Method: Highly accurate, uses spectrophotometer.
   - Sahli’s Method: Visual comparison; less precise.
2. **Other Methods**
   - Gasometric, Chemical, Specific Gravity, Point-of-Care Testing.

## Procedure

1. Fill the graduated tube with 0.1N HCl to the lowest point.
2. Sterilize the finger and make a bold prick.
3. Collect blood up to 20 μL in the pipette and mix with acid in the tube.
4. Mix thoroughly and let stand for 2–5 minutes.
5. Add distilled water dropwise until the colour matches the comparator.
6. Record the volume in the tube when the colours match.

**Normal Hb levels:**  
- Men: 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL  
- Women: 12 to 15.5 g/dL

**Report:**  
The haemoglobin level was found to be ______ g/dL.
