## Introduction

*Hemo* means blood, *cyto* means cell, and *meter* refers to measuring or counting; hemocytometry is the process of counting or measuring blood cells. A hemocytometer is a device used for determining the number of cells per unit volume of suspension and is the most widely used chamber for blood cell counts.

### Haemocytometer Set Consists of:
- Neubauer’s Counting Chamber
- Diluting Pipettes (RBC & WBC)

#### Neubauer’s Counting Chamber

A thick glass slide with two identical ruled areas separated by empty space and two elevated ridges on both sides. The counting square is 9 sq.mm (3mm × 3mm). The four corner squares (1 sq.mm each) are used for white blood cell counts. The central ruled area is divided into 25 large squares, each subdivided into 16 smaller squares (each 1/400 sq.mm). The depth of the improved Neubauer chamber is 0.1 mm.

#### Diluting Pipette

A glass tube pipette with a rubber suction arrangement, graduated from 0 to 1 (in 0.1 units). The bulb portion can hold 100 units, graduated from 1 to 101. The bulb serves as a mixing chamber.

| Feature        | RBC Pipette    | WBC Pipette    |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Bead Colour    | Red            | White          |
| Markings       | 0.5, 1, 101    | 0.5, 1, 11     |
| Dilution Ratio | 1:200          | 1:20           |

#### Diluting Fluids

**RBC Diluting Fluids:**  
Common components include sodium chloride (osmolarity), sodium sulfate (prevents aggregation, acts as anticoagulant and fixative), mercuric chloride (preservative, antifungal, antibacterial), and glacial acetic acid.

**WBC Diluting Fluids:**  
Typically contains 2.0 ml glacial acetic acid, 97.0 ml distilled water, and 1.0 g gentian violet. Glacial acetic acid lyses RBCs, while gentian violet stains WBC nuclei.
