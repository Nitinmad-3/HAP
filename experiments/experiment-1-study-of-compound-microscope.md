<summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>

A microscope is an optical instrument used to magnify objects or images for detailed examination. The compound microscope was invented in the 1590s by Hans Janssen and Zacharias Janssen. A compound microscope is a high-magnification instrument that uses two lenses to multiply the level of magnification: the objective lens and the eyepiece lens.

### Non-optical Parts

- **Base:** U- or horseshoe-shaped metallic structure supporting the microscope.
- **Pillar:** Connects the base and the arm.
- **Arm (Limb):** Metallic handle supporting the stage and body tube.
- **Inclination Joint:** Allows tilting of the microscope for sitting posture.
- **Stage:** Metallic platform with a central hole.
- **Body Tube:** Holds objective and ocular lenses; pathway for light rays.
- **Draw Tube:** Holds the ocular lens.
- **Adjustment Screws:** Coarse and fine adjustment for focusing.

### Optical Parts

- **Diaphragm:** Regulates the amount of light; disc and iris types.
- **Condenser:** Focuses light, adjusted up or down.
- **Reflector:** Mirror with plane and concave sides for directing light.
- **Objective Lenses:** Low power, high power, and oil immersion types.
- **Ocular Lens:** Eyepiece for viewing; magnifications include 5X, 10X, 15X, 20X.

The compound microscope has four systems:
1. **Support System:** Tube, arm, nosepiece, stage, foot.
2. **Magnification System:** Lenses.
3. **Adjustment System:** Coarse/fine adjustment knobs, condenser adjustment, iris diaphragm lever.
4. **Illumination System:** Light source, mirror, condenser.

<summary><strong>Procedure</strong></summary>

1. **Preparation:**
   - Place the microscope on a stable, flat surface.
   - Clean the lenses with lens paper.
   - Plug in and turn on the light source.

2. **Slide Preparation:**
   - Prepare a slide with the specimen and add a coverslip.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - Start with the lowest power objective lens (e.g., 4x or 10x).
   - Place the slide on the stage and secure with clips.
   - Position the specimen over the light source.

4. **Focusing:**
   - Use coarse focus to bring the specimen into view.
   - Use fine focus for a sharp image.

5. **Observation:**
   - Adjust light intensity and condenser.
   - Systematically scan the specimen.

6. **Higher Magnification:**
   - Switch to a higher power objective lens if needed.
   - Refocus using fine focus only.
   - Adjust light intensity as needed.
   - Use the concave mirror for low power; use the plane mirror for high power or oil immersion.

7. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the slide.
   - Turn off the light source.
   - Clean the lenses and stage.
   - Cover the microscope.

<summary><strong>Tips</strong></summary>

- Always start with the lowest power objective lens.
- Use lens paper for cleaning.
- Adjust light and condenser for best image.
- Focus carefully to avoid damaging slides.
- Keep both eyes open when observing.
- Handle slides with care and dispose safely.
