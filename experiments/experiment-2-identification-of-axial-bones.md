## Introduction

The skeleton is the internal framework of bones and cartilage that supports and protects the body, enables movement, and stores minerals.

### Parts of the Skeleton
- **Bones:** Skull, spine, ribs, shoulder blades, collar bones, etc.
- **Cartilage:** Flexible connective tissue.
- **Ligaments and Tendons:** Connect bones and muscles.
- **Joints:** Allow bone movement.

### Functions
- Support soft tissues and organs.
- Protect vital organs.
- Enable movement.
- Store minerals (calcium, phosphate).
- Produce blood cells in bone marrow.

## Axial Skeleton

The endoskeleton is divided into:
- **Axial Skeleton (80 bones):** Skull, vertebral column, rib cage, sternum.
- **Appendicular Skeleton.**

The axial skeleton maintains upright posture and transmits body weight.

### Skull
- **Cranium (8 bones):** Frontal, parietal (2), temporal (2), occipital, sphenoid, ethmoid.
- **Ear Ossicles (3):** Malleus, incus, stapes.
- **Hyoid Bone (1):** Supports the throat.
- **Facial Bones:** Maxilla (2), mandible (1), lacrimal (2), inferior nasal conchae (2), vomer (1), zygomatic (2), nasal bones (2), palatine (2).

### Vertebral Column
- **Cervical Vertebrae (7):** Neck region.
- **Thoracic Vertebrae (12):** Attach to ribs.
- **Lumbar Vertebrae (5):** Lower back.
- **Sacrum (1):** Connects spine to pelvis.
- **Coccyx (1):** Tailbone.

### Sternum
- Flat bone in the chest (manubrium, body, xiphoid process).

### Ribs
- **12 pairs:**  
  - **True ribs (1–7):** Directly attached to sternum.
  - **False ribs (8–10):** Indirectly attached.
  - **Floating ribs (11–12):** Not attached to sternum.
