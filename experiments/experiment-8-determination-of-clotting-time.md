## Introduction

Clotting time measures how long it takes for blood to clot, helping to screen for bleeding disorders or monitor anticoagulant therapy.

### Principle

Clotting time (coagulation time) is based on hemostasis—the process that stops bleeding. It involves:
- **Blood coagulation cascade:** Enzymatic reactions activate clotting factors, leading to fibrin formation.
- **Fibrinogen to fibrin:** Fibrin forms a mesh-like network, trapping cells and platelets to create a clot.

**Factors affecting clotting time:**
- Clotting factor deficiencies
- Medications (anticoagulants)
- Liver disease

## Procedure: Capillary Glass Tube Method

1. Sterilize the fingertip and make a bold prick for free blood flow.
2. Collect blood into a 15 cm capillary glass tube.
3. Leave the tube undisturbed horizontally for 1–2 minutes.
4. Break off a small piece of the tube every 30 seconds until a fine thread of clotted blood appears.
5. When the thread appears, stop the stopwatch.

The period between appearance of blood and formation of a clot is the clotting time.

**Report:**  
The clotting time of my own blood sample was found to be ____ minute(s) and ____ seconds.
