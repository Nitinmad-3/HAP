## Introduction

Arterial blood pressure is the force exerted by blood on the walls of blood vessels as the heart contracts and relaxes. Systolic pressure is the force during heart contraction; diastolic is the force during relaxation.

**Methods for Recording Blood Pressure:**
- Oscillatory Method (feeling the pulse)
- Palpatory Method (observing mercury level oscillations)
- Auscultatory Method (listening to artery sounds with stethoscope; most common in labs)

The sphygmomanometer measures pressure, typically in the brachial artery.

## Procedure (Auscultatory Method)

1. Place stethoscope over brachial artery in antecubital space.
2. Wrap cuff around arm, center rubber bag over artery.
3. Inflate cuff to close artery; release air slowly.
4. When pressure equals artery pressure, blood returns and pulse sounds begin (heard via stethoscope).
5. First pulse sound = systolic pressure (reading on manometer).
6. Sounds continue as cuff deflates; last sound = diastolic pressure.

**Korotkoff Phases:**
- Phase I: Clear tapping (systolic)
- Phase II: Softer, murmured
- Phase III: Louder again
- Phase IV: Sudden muffling (diastolic)
- Phase V: Sounds disappear
