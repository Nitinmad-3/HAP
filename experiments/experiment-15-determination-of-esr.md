# Experiment 15: Determination of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)

**Aim:**  
To determine erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

**Requirements:**  
Denatured spirit or ethanol solution, cotton swab, lancet, syringe, Westergren’s ESR pipette

**References:**

## Introduction

ESR is measured in the laboratory by methods such as:
- Westergren method (recommended by international standards)
- Wintrobe’s method
- Cutler’s method

**Westergren Method:**  
Uses a glass pipette 30 cm long, 2.5 mm diameter, with a graduated scale in mm over the lower 20 cm. ESR is the rate at which erythrocytes sediment in anticoagulated blood held vertically, expressed as the fall (in mm) at the end of the first hour.

**Normal Values (Westergren’s Method):**
- Males: 0–5 mm/hr
- Females: 0–7 mm/hr

## Procedure (Westergren Method)

1. Mix the blood sample well, draw into Westergren pipette to the 0 mm mark using rubber teat.
2. Use anticoagulant (3.8% trisodium citrate), mix one part anticoagulant with four parts blood.
3. Fill pipette to 0 mark, clamp vertically in Westergren rack.
4. Leave undisturbed for 60 min (no vibrations, no direct sunlight).
5. Read the upper level of red cells after 1 hour.

**Precautions:**
- Pipette must be clean and dry.
- Dilute sample just before setting up ESR.
- Never use mouth suction.
- Keep pipette vertical.
- Room temperature (18–25°C).

**Report:**  
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be ______ mm/hr.
