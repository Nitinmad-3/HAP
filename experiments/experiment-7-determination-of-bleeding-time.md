# Experiment 7: Determination of Bleeding Time (Duke’s Method)

**Aim:**  
To determine the bleeding time of my own blood sample by Duke’s method.

**Requirements:**  
Lancet, denatured spirit or ethanol solution, cotton swab, filter paper, stopwatch

## Introduction

Bleeding time is the interval required for a small cut to stop bleeding, reflecting the formation of a platelet plug. Normal bleeding time is 1–3 minutes. This test is mainly used for diagnosing hemorrhagic diseases and is helpful prior to surgeries.

### Principle

Duke’s method assesses primary hemostasis—the initial response to bleeding, involving:
1. **Vascular constriction:** Blood vessels narrow to reduce flow.
2. **Platelet plug formation:** Platelets adhere and aggregate at the injury site.

## Procedure

1. Sterilize the fingertip and make a bold prick for free blood flow.
2. Start the stopwatch and touch the drop of blood to filter paper.
3. Every 30 seconds, touch the blood to a new spot on filter paper.
4. Continue until bleeding stops.
5. Stop the stopwatch and record the time.

**Prolonged bleeding time may indicate:**
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
- Platelet dysfunction
- Vascular abnormalities
- Von Willebrand disease

**Report:**  
The bleeding time of my own blood was found to be ______ minute(s) and _____ seconds.
