## Introduction

A fertilized egg divides to produce three primary germ cell layers, which differentiate to form the tissues of the body. The human body is composed of four basic tissue types:
- Epithelial tissue
- Connective tissue
- Muscular tissue
- Nervous tissue

## Epithelial Tissue

Epithelial cells cover or line all body surfaces, cavities, and tubes (covering epithelia), and form secretory glands (glandular epithelia).

**General Characteristics:**
- Closely attached; form protective barriers.
- One free (apical) surface exposed to outside or cavity.
- One fixed (basal) surface attached to connective tissue.
- No blood vessels (avascular); receives nutrients from underlying tissue.
- Highly innervated.
- Excellent regenerative capacity.

**Functions:**
- Protection from radiation, toxins, pathogens, trauma.
- Regulation and exchange of chemicals.
- Secretion (glands, hormones, sweat, mucus, enzymes).
- Sensation.
- Absorption (gut lining).
- Filtration (kidneys).
- Formation of glands.

**Classification:**
- **By thickness:**
  - Simple (one cell layer)
  - Stratified (multiple layers, named by apical cell shape)
- **By shape:**
  - Squamous (flat)
  - Cuboidal (cube-shaped)
  - Columnar (tall)

**Types:**
1. **Simple Squamous:** Single layer, passive transport, alveoli, blood vessels.
2. **Simple Cuboidal:** Secretion/absorption, kidney tubules, glands.
3. **Simple Columnar:** Absorption/secretion, digestive tract, gall bladder.
4. **Stratified Squamous:** Protection, oral cavity, cervix, anal canal.
5. **Stratified Cuboidal:** Protection, ducts of sweat/mammary/salivary glands.
6. **Stratified Columnar:** Protection/secretion, male urethra.
7. **Pseudostratified Columnar:** Secretion/propulsion, trachea.
8. **Transitional:** Stretching/protection, bladder, urethra.

## Connective Tissue

Connective tissues connect different parts of the body.

**General Characteristics:**
- Maximum extracellular matrix (ECM), minimal cells.
- Contains cells, fibers, and ground substance.

**Functions:**
- Support, binding.
- Holding body fluids.
- Defense (macrophages, plasma cells, mast cells, WBCs).
- Nutrient storage (fat).

**Types:**
1. **Areolar:** Gel-like matrix, holds fluids, under epithelia.
2. **Adipose:** Fat storage, insulation, under skin, around organs.
3. **Reticular:** Network supporting lymphoid organs.
4. **Irregular Connective:** Collagen fibers, elasticity/support, dermis, joints.
5. **Regular Connective:** Parallel fibers, tendons and ligaments.
6. **Hyaline Cartilage:** Firm matrix, support, embryonic skeleton, nose.
7. **Elastic Cartilage:** Flexible, external ear.
8. **Fibrocartilage:** Tough, intervertebral discs, knee.
9. **Bone:** Hard matrix, support/protection, mineral storage, blood cell formation.
10. **Blood:** Liquid matrix, transport gases/nutrients/wastes.
