<summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>

A microscope is an optical instrument used to magnify objects or images for detailed examination. The compound microscope was invented in the 1590s by Hans Janssen and Zacharias Janssen. A compound microscope is a high-magnification instrument that uses two lenses to multiply the level of magnification: the objective lens and the eyepiece lens.

## Parts of Compound Microscope

### Non-optical Parts

- <strong>Base:</strong> U- or horseshoe-shaped metallic structure supporting the microscope.
- <strong>Pillar:</strong> Connects the base and the arm.
- <strong>Arm (Limb):</strong> Metallic handle supporting the stage and body tube.
- <strong>Inclination Joint:</strong> Allows tilting of the microscope for sitting posture.
- <strong>Stage:</strong> Metallic platform with a central hole.
- <strong>Body Tube:</strong> Holds objective and ocular lenses; pathway for light rays.
- <strong>Draw Tube:</strong> Holds the ocular lens.
- <strong>Adjustment Screws:</strong> Coarse and fine adjustment for focusing.

### Optical Parts

- <strong>Diaphragm:</strong> Regulates the amount of light; disc and iris types.
- <strong>Condenser:</strong> Focuses light, adjusted up or down.
- <strong>Reflector:</strong> Mirror with plane and concave sides for directing light.
- <strong>Objective Lenses:</strong> Low power, high power, and oil immersion types.
- <strong>Ocular Lens:</strong> Eyepiece for viewing; magnifications include 5X, 10X, 15X, 20X.

The compound microscope has four systems:
1. <strong>Support System:</strong> Tube, arm, nosepiece, stage, foot.
2. <strong>Magnification System:</strong> Lenses.
3. <strong>Adjustment System:</strong> Coarse/fine adjustment knobs, condenser adjustment, iris diaphragm lever.
4. <strong>Illumination System:</strong> Light source, mirror, condenser.

<summary><strong>Procedure</strong></summary>

1. <strong>Preparation:</strong>
   - Place the microscope on a stable, flat surface.
   - Clean the lenses with lens paper.
   - Plug in and turn on the light source.

2. <strong>Slide Preparation:</strong>
   - Prepare a slide with the specimen and add a coverslip.

3. <strong>Initial Setup:</strong>
   - Start with the lowest power objective lens (e.g., 4x or 10x).
   - Place the slide on the stage and secure with clips.
   - Position the specimen over the light source.

4. <strong>Focusing:</strong>
   - Use coarse focus to bring the specimen into view.
   - Use fine focus for a sharp image.

5. <strong>Observation:</strong>
   - Adjust light intensity and condenser.
   - Systematically scan the specimen.

6. <strong>Higher Magnification:</strong>
   - Switch to a higher power objective lens if needed.
   - Refocus using fine focus only.
   - Adjust light intensity as needed.
   - Use the concave mirror for low power; use the plane mirror for high power or oil immersion.

7. <strong>Cleanup:</strong>
   - Remove the slide.
   - Turn off the light source.
   - Clean the lenses and stage.
   - Cover the microscope.

<summary><strong>Tips</strong></summary>

- Always start with the lowest power objective lens.
- Use lens paper for cleaning.
- Adjust light and condenser for best image.
- Focus carefully to avoid damaging slides.
- Keep both eyes open when observing.
- Handle slides with care and dispose safely.
